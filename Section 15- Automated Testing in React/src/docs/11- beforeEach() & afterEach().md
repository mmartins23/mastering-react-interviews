### Explanation of `beforeEach()` and `afterEach()` in Jest

#### beforeEach()
`beforeEach()` is a function provided by Jest that allows you to run some setup code before each test case within a `describe` block. It's commonly used to initialize variables, set up mocks, or perform actions that need to happen before each individual test runs. This ensures that each test starts with a clean slate and reduces code duplication.

#### Usage:
- **Setup for Tests:** You can use `beforeEach()` to render a component, initialize variables, or set up any necessary state that your tests depend on.
- **Avoiding Duplication:** Instead of repeating the same setup code in each test, `beforeEach()` helps centralize setup logic and makes tests more maintainable.

#### Example:
```javascript
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import Counter from './Counter';

beforeEach(() => {
    render(<Counter />);
});

test('Initial value of counter should be 0', () => {
    const counterEl = screen.getByTestId("cnt");
    expect(counterEl).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(counterEl.textContent).toBe("0");
});
```
In this example, `beforeEach()` ensures that `<Counter />` is rendered before each test, so each test starts with the initial state of the counter component.

#### afterEach()
`afterEach()` is another function provided by Jest that runs after each test case in a `describe` block. It's used for cleanup tasks such as resetting global variables or cleaning up resources that were allocated during the tests.

#### Usage:
- **Cleanup:** Use `afterEach()` to clean up after tests, reset state, or clear mocks.
- **Avoid Side Effects:** Ensures that each test is isolated from others by cleaning up any changes made during the test.

#### Example:
```javascript
import { cleanup, render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import Counter from './Counter';

beforeEach(() => {
    render(<Counter />);
});

afterEach(() => {
    cleanup(); // Ensures cleanup after each test
});

test('Initial value of counter should be 0', () => {
    const counterEl = screen.getByTestId("cnt");
    expect(counterEl).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(counterEl.textContent).toBe("0");
});
```
In this example, `cleanup()` inside `afterEach()` ensures that any cleanup needed after each test (such as unmounting components or clearing DOM) is performed consistently.

### Answering the Provided Question

In your example, `beforeEach()` is used to render the `<Counter />` component before each test case. This ensures that each test starts with the component in its initial state, reducing redundancy and ensuring consistency across tests.

Hereâ€™s the breakdown of your test file:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { fireEvent, render, screen, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';
import Counter from './Counter';

beforeEach(() => {
    render(<Counter />);
});

test('Initial value of counter should be 0', () => {
    const counterEl = screen.getByTestId("cnt");
    expect(counterEl).toBeInTheDocument();
    expect(counterEl.textContent).toBe("0");
});

test('On click, it should increment by 1 using userEvent', async () => {
    const btnEl = screen.getByTestId("btn");
    const counterEl = screen.getByTestId("cnt");
    expect(counterEl.textContent).toBe("0");
    userEvent.click(btnEl);
    await waitFor(() => expect(counterEl.textContent).toBe("1"));
});

test("Input should have 10 as initial value", () => {
    const inputEl = screen.getByTestId("input");
    expect(inputEl.value).toBe("10");
});

test("Entering value in input works", () => {
    const inputEl = screen.getByTestId("input");
    fireEvent.change(inputEl, {
        target: {
            value: "11"
        }
    });
    expect(inputEl.value).toBe("11");
});
```

- **`beforeEach(() => { render(<Counter />); })`:** This renders the `<Counter />` component before each test case, ensuring a clean starting point for each test.
- **`test('Initial value of counter should be 0', () => { ... })`:** Verifies that the counter initially displays '0' after rendering.
- **`test('On click, it should increment by 1 using userEvent', async () => { ... })`:** Uses `userEvent` to simulate a click on a button and verifies that the counter increments correctly.
- **`test("Input should have 10 as initial value", () => { ... })`:** Checks that an input field initially displays '10'.
- **`test("Entering value in input works", () => { ... })`:** Tests that changing the input value updates it correctly.

By using `beforeEach()` to render `<Counter />` before each test, you ensure that each test starts from the same initial state of the component, making your tests more reliable and easier to maintain.
