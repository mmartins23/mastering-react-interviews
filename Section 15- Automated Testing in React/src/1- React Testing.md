### 1. How the Test Files are Named

In a React project, test files are typically named in a way that reflects the component or module they are testing. There are a few common naming conventions:

- **For Component Files:**
  - Component file: `Product.jsx`
  - Test file: `Product.test.jsx`

- **Alternative Naming Convention:**
  - Component file: `Product.jsx`
  - Test file: `Product.spec.jsx`

The `*.test.js` or `*.spec.js` suffix helps Jest identify test files automatically.

### 2. How to Run Tests

To run tests in a React project using Jest, you generally use npm or yarn commands. Here are the common commands:

- **Using npm:**
  - To run all tests: 
    ```bash
    npm test
    ```
  - To run all tests (alternative command):
    ```bash
    npm run test
    ```

- **Using yarn:**
  - To run all tests:
    ```bash
    yarn test
    ```

### Additional Notes

- **Jest Configuration:**
  Jest configuration is usually found in the `package.json` file under the `jest` field or in a separate `jest.config.js` file.
  
- **Test Scripts:**
  The `package.json` typically contains a script entry for running tests. Here’s an example:

  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  }
  ```

### Example

Here’s a practical example to tie everything together:

1. **Component File:**
   - `src/components/Product.jsx`

2. **Test File:**
   - `src/components/Product.test.jsx`

3. **Running Tests:**
   - Run the following command in your terminal to execute all tests:

     ```bash
     npm test
     ```

By following these conventions and commands, you can effectively organize and run tests in your React project using Jest.
