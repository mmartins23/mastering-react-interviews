In the given React component, the two buttons have different behaviors due to the way their `onClick` handlers are assigned. Let's break down the differences:

### Code Explanation
```javascript
import React from 'react';

const Events = () => {
    const getData = () => {
        console.log("Function Called ...");
    }
  
    return (
        <div>
            <button onClick={getData}>Get Data</button>
            <button onClick={getData()}>Get Data</button>
        </div>
    );
}

export default Events;
```

### Button 1: `onClick={getData}`
- **Code**: `<button onClick={getData}>Get Data</button>`
- **Behavior**:
  - Here, the `onClick` attribute is assigned the function `getData` itself.
  - This means that when the button is clicked, React will call the `getData` function.
  - The function is called only when the button is actually clicked by the user.
  - This is the correct way to handle click events.

### Button 2: `onClick={getData()}`
- **Code**: `<button onClick={getData()}>Get Data</button>`
- **Behavior**:
  - In this case, `getData()` is being called immediately as soon as the component renders.
  - This is because the parentheses `()` cause the function to execute immediately.
  - The result of `getData()`, which is `undefined` (since `getData` does not return anything), is then assigned to the `onClick` attribute.
  - This means that there is no function assigned to handle the click event, and the button will not perform any action on click.
  - Essentially, the button does nothing when clicked because `undefined` is not a function.

### Summary
- **`onClick={getData}`** assigns the function `getData` as the click handler, so it will be called when the button is clicked.
- **`onClick={getData()}`** calls `getData` immediately during rendering and assigns its return value (`undefined`) as the click handler, resulting in no function being called on click.

To correctly handle click events, you should always pass the function reference (e.g., `getData`) without invoking it. If you need to pass arguments to the function, you can use an arrow function or bind the function appropriately. For example:

```javascript
<button onClick={() => getData()}>Get Data</button>
```

or if `getData` takes parameters:

```javascript
const getData = (param) => {
    console.log("Function Called with", param);
}

<button onClick={() => getData('some parameter')}>Get Data</button>
```

This ensures that `getData` is called only when the button is clicked, and you can pass arguments as needed.
