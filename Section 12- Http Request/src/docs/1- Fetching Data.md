# Fetching Data

Your `App` component is set up to fetch data from an API (`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`) when a button is clicked. Let's walk through your existing setup and make sure everything is clear:

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Importing CSS:**
   - You've imported a CSS file (`App.css`) although it's not explicitly used in your current JSX. This file might contain styles that could be applied to your `App` component or its children.

   ```jsx
   import './App.css';
   ```

2. **Defining the `fetchUsers` Function:**
   - You have a function `fetchUsers` defined inside your `App` component. This function uses `fetch` to make a GET request to the specified URL (`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`).
   - After receiving a response, the JSON data is extracted using `.json()` method, and then logged to the console using `console.log()`.

   ```jsx
   const fetchUsers = () => {
     fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users')
       .then(response => response.json())
       .then(json => console.log(json));
   }
   ```

3. **Rendering the Button:**
   - In the JSX part of your `App` component, you render a `<button>` element.
   - The `onClick` attribute is set to call the `fetchUsers` function when the button is clicked.

   ```jsx
   return (
     <div className="App">
       <button onClick={fetchUsers}>Get Users</button>
     </div>
   );
   ```

4. **Exporting the Component:**
   - Finally, your `App` component is exported as the default export of this module.

   ```jsx
   export default App;
   ```

### Conclusion

Your current setup is straightforward and functional for fetching data from an API upon a button click. Upon clicking the "Get Users" button, the `fetchUsers` function will execute, making a request to fetch user data from `jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`, and logging the retrieved JSON data to the console.

Remember to handle the retrieved data as needed in your application, such as displaying it in the UI, storing it in state, or passing it down as props to other components. This approach ensures that your React application can interact with external APIs and manage asynchronous data fetching effectively.
